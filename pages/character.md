## Playable Races

One of the basic components of the player character's identity is their race. There are plans for 4 playable races: human, dwarf, elf, half-giant. However, in the early versions of the game, not all of them may be available to play.

### Human

_"Disease, weed and human… let a little bit sprout up and sooner than you expect, the world’s full of it." ~ a proud elf_

The most common race in the continent has also been holding the most political power for over three hundred years. Humans are smart, diplomatic and excellent strategists. This race is not as ancient as dwarves or elves, nor do humans live as long. But they bear child more often, and are much eager to expand their reach. Their smiths are not as skilled as those of the dwarves, but their innovation is unparalleled. Their mages are not as powerful as those of the elves, but their thirst for knowledge knows no bounds. Humans of Zeneria are predominantly brown skinned, dark haired, tall and healthy. Their lives span anywhere between seventy to ninety years, unless taken early.

### Dwarf

_"Dwarves have mined these lands for fifteen millennia. If you dig now and find gold, it’s not mining, it’s archeology." ~ an Ozar merchant_

Delvers of the deep and artificers of the most legendary creations in history, the dwarves have dwelt in Zeneria for over ten thousand years before the first humans were known to exist. The tales of lost dwarven cities full of boundless treasure have spelled doom for many adventurers through the ages. Dwarves can naturally live significantly longer lives than humans, but their love of battle glory make that difficult. They also love stories and ale, both of which are found aplenty in taverns, where happy dwarves are a common sight. Dwarves are of short stature and light skin, and their hair varies from fiery red to dark brown. Their natural lifespan is of about hundred and thirty to hundred and seventy years, but their life expectancy is usually not over hundred and ten.

### Elf

_"Elves live long enough to master several disciplines our lives are just too short for. Humility isn't one of them." ~ a veteran human_

Twelve centuries before humans named it the Zenerian Empire, an elf king united the powers of the continent into one. \
Continental elves are willowy and fair. The colour of their hair ranges from light auburn to golden, although some prefer to dye their hair with darker shades. Elves have lives that can span ten times the length of human ones, and they do much to maintain it so.

### Half-giant

_"Half-giants have been allies to dwarves since dawn of time, even though, one might say we don't quite see eye to eye, heh." ~ a drunk dwarf_

People of this race are not a common sight, but their presence is hard to miss. \
Half-giants are towering hulks of inhuman strength, but despite their obvious physical advantages, they do not naturally live longer than sixty years. They are pale of skin and their hair varies from the colour of ash to the colour of snow.
