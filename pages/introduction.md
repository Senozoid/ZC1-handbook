# Introduction

_A strange disturbance stirs the land. Stories have been heard of otherworldly things lurking in the shadows, monsters from old tales appearing as though from thin air. Strife has awoken in the royal family of the coastal kingdom in the south. Across the desert to the west, a princess has gone missing. A killer moves through an old city, leaving a trail of blood. Dark rumours are spreading, of civil unrest, and whispers of rebellion. Odd happenings plague the land, riddles unsolved, nightmares in the dark. It is as if something evil broods just beneath the surface, waiting in malice, a wicked thread that connects everything, a shadow... of doom._

Shadow of Doom is a text-based **fantasy adventure** game with extensive player agency. It is more than just a simple CYOA game where you can only pick your path through the story. It is also a full-fledged **RPG** that offers playable fantasy races, skills, levelling, inventory system, even optional combat!

It does NOT require an internet connection, or even a graphics card. You can install and play it on your 10-year-old laptop if you want to. And I plan to eventually, but not anytime soon, make a version for you to play it on your phone as well.

This is my love-letter to gaming and high fantasy literature. It is, and will always be, completely **FREE** to play. My reward will be knowing that you played and enjoyed it, so don't forget to reach out and tell me how you felt, and to suggest any improvements.

## Getting Started

### Downloading

WIP: Links and how-tos will be added soon.

#### GitHub

#### Itch

#### GameJolt

### Installing

If you get the game through the Itch.io desktop app, it takes care of your installation automatically. Otherwise, follow the instructions here.

#### Installing on Windows

The game can be downloaded for Windows in two formats. Description and instructions for each are given below. Make sure you always scan any downloaded files with Windows Defender (or any other antivirus of your choice) before opening them.

##### Executable Installer

If you want to make the setup process as simple as possible, the executable installer is the better option. It installs the game on your computer, automatically creates shortcuts to launch it, and gives you the option to uninstall it later from "Apps & features" in Windows Settings (or "Programs and Features" in Control Panel).

Run the installer you downloaded and follow the prompts on the screen. You can choose the installation location and whether to create shortcuts on the desktop and in the start menu, and the installer will take care of everything. To play the game, just use any of the installed shortcuts.

##### Portable Zip (pre-installed)

The portable zip is a pre-installed folder compressed into a zip file, which is the better option if you want to install your game on removable media like a flash drive, so that you can continue your playthrough on a different computer later.

Just unzip the downloaded file into the location of your choice and you are all set. You can play the game by running the "Launcher.exe" file in the created folder. You can move and rename the folder as you wish without any problems. If you want to create a desktop shortcut, you have to do so manually. To uninstall the game, just delete the installation folder.

#### Installing on macOS or Linux

> The game needs you to have bash, which is probably already in your system by default. But you can confirm this by running `cat /etc/shells` on the terminal and seeing if "/bin/bash" is listed.

The UNIX version is just the game directory compressed into a tgz (tar.gz) file, very similar to the portable zip for Windows. To install, extract it into the location of your choice and change permissions so that you can execute the files in the game directory. After that, you can play the game just by running the "Launcher" file in the directory.

If you are not sure how to do all that, just replace the "filename" and "installation-path" in the following commands, and run them on the terminal. If there are any problems with these commands, please [let me know](#report-problems).

Setup:

```bash
tar -xzvf filename.tgz -C installation-path
chmod +x installation-path/Launcher
```

Launch:

```bash
cd installation-path
./Launcher
```

If you have any problems, questions or suggestions regarding this handbook, please feel free to let me know [here](https://github.com/Senozoid/ZC1-handbook/discussions/new?category=questions-suggestions-and-help) (GitHub login required). This is not for reporting bugs you have found in the game, this place is for the handbook only. For bugs you have found in the game, you can let me know over at [this place]() (link coming soon).

To get started, make a post asking your question, describing a problem you have encountered, or a change you want me to do. You can attach screenshots to make it easier. Don't be shy, no suggestion is too silly to be considered and no problem is too silly to be solved.
