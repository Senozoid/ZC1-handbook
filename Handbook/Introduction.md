# Introduction

_A strange disturbance stirs the land. Stories have been heard of otherworldly things lurking in the shadows, monsters from old tales appearing as though from thin air. Strife has awoken in the royal family of the coastal kingdom in the south. Across the desert to the west, a princess has gone missing. A killer moves through an old city, leaving a trail of blood. Dark rumours are spreading, of civil unrest, and whispers of rebellion. Odd happenings plague the land, riddles unsolved, nightmares in the dark. It is as if something evil broods just beneath the surface, waiting in malice, a wicked thread that connects everything, a shadow... of doom._

Shadow of Doom is a text-based **fantasy adventure** game with extensive player agency. It is more than just a simple CYOA game where you can only pick your path through the story. It is also a full-fledged **RPG** that offers playable fantasy races, skills, levelling, inventory system, even optional combat!

It does not require an internet connection, or even a graphics card. You can install and play it on your 10-year-old laptop if you want to. And I plan to eventually, but not anytime soon, make a version for you to play it on your phone as well.

This is my love-letter to gaming and high fantasy literature. It is, and will always be, completely **FREE** to play. My reward will be knowing that you played and enjoyed it, so don't forget to reach out and tell me how you felt, and to suggest any improvements.
