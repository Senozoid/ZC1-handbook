_A strange disturbance stirs the land. Stories have been heard of otherworldly things lurking in the shadows, monsters from old tales appearing as though from thin air. Strife has awoken in the royal family of the coastal kingdom in the south. Across the desert to the west, a princess has gone missing. A killer moves through an old city, leaving a trail of blood. Dark rumours are spreading, of civil unrest, and whispers of rebellion. Odd happenings plague the land, riddles unsolved, nightmares in the dark. It is as if something evil broods just beneath the surface, waiting in malice, a wicked thread that connects everything, a shadow... of doom._

Shadow of Doom is a text-based **fantasy adventure** game with extensive player agency. It is more than just a simple CYOA game where you can only pick your path through the story. It is also a full-fledged **RPG** that offers playable fantasy races, skills, levelling, inventory system, even optional combat!

It does not require an internet connection, or even a graphics card. You can install and play it on your 10-year-old laptop if you want to. And I plan to eventually, but not anytime soon, make a version for you to play it on your phone as well.

This is my love-letter to gaming and high fantasy literature. It is, and will always be, completely **FREE** to play. My reward will be knowing that you played and enjoyed it, so don't forget to reach out and tell me how you felt, and to suggest any improvements.

## Getting Started

### Downloading

WIP: Links and how-tos will be added soon.

#### Itch.io

#### GitHub

### Installing

If you get the game through the Itch.io desktop client (or butler), it takes care of your installation automatically. Otherwise, follow the instructions here.

#### Installing On Windows

The game can be downloaded for Windows in two formats. Description and instructions for each are given below. Make sure you always scan any downloaded files with Windows Defender (or any other antivirus of your choice) before opening them.

##### Portable Zip (pre-installed)

The portable zip is a pre-installed folder compressed into a zip file, which is the better option if you want to play your game on multiple computers through removable media like a flash drive. 

Just unzip the downloaded file into the location of your choice and you are all set. You can play the game by running the "Launcher.exe" file in the created folder. If you want to create a desktop shortcut, you have to do so manually.

##### Executable Installer

The executable installer is better if you want to install the game on a specific computer and want to automatically create shortcuts for it, and also have the option to uninstall it from "Apps & features" in Windows Settings (or "Programs and Features" in Control Panel). 

Run the installer you downloaded and follow the prompts on the screen. You can choose the installation location and whether to create shortcuts on the desktop and in the start menu, and the installer will take care of everything. To play the game, just use any of the installed shortcuts.

#### Installing On Linux

The Linux version is just the game directory compressed into a small file. To install, extract it into the location of your choice and change permissions so that you can execute the "Launcher" file. After that, you can play the game by opening the game directory in the terminal and running `./Launcher`.
