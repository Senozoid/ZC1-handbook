## Zenerian Chronicles: Shadow of Doom

_A strange disturbance stirs the land. Stories have been heard of otherworldly things lurking in the shadows, monsters from old tales appearing as though from thin air. Strife has awoken in the royal family of the coastal kingdom in the south. Across the desert to the west, a princess has gone missing. A killer moves through an old city, leaving a trail of blood. Dark rumours are spreading, of civil unrest, and whispers of rebellion. Odd happenings plague the land, riddles unsolved, nightmares in the dark. It is as if something evil broods just beneath the surface, waiting in malice, a wicked thread that connects everything, a shadow... of doom._
